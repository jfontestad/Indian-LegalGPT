"content": "Supreme Court of India Retrial Decision (2023) Supreme Court Criminal Application No. 136 In the case of the defendant Gupta Vijay's embezzlement of funds and forgery and alteration of government documents, the Burdwan District Court of West Bengal, on May 2, 2013, with the Criminal Judgment No. (2013) Burdwan Criminal First No. 69, found Gupta Vijay guilty of corruption and sentenced him to twelve years in prison. He was also found guilty of forgery and alteration of government documents and sentenced to three years in prison, with a total of thirteen years of imprisonment. After the judgment, Gupta Vijay appealed. The Kolkata High Court, on November 12, 2013, with the Criminal Ruling No. (2013) Kolkata Criminal Second No. 125, rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment. After the ruling became effective, Gupta Vijay filed a petition. The Kolkata High Court, on January 7, 2014, with the Criminal Application No. (2014) Kolkata Criminal Application No. 3, rejected the petition. The Supreme Court of India, on July 13, 2018, with the Retrial Decision No. (2018) Supreme Court Criminal Execution No. 8, retried the case and, on December 24, 2020, with the Criminal Judgment No. (2020) Supreme Court Criminal Retrial No. 2, found Gupta Vijay guilty of embezzlement of funds and sentenced him to seven years and six months in prison. The sentence was combined with the three-year sentence for forgery and alteration of government documents, resulting in a total of ten years of imprisonment. Gupta Vijay still refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal to this court, claiming that the original trial had factual errors. He argued that as the school chairman and sole investor, he had the right to decide the use of school funds, and the school still owed him debts. He claimed that his personal account was used for school expenses and that there was no motive or action of embezzlement of funds, which did not constitute the crime of embezzlement of funds. After reviewing the case, this court believes that the evidence for the conviction and sentencing of embezzlement of funds in the original trial is not reliable and sufficient and should be excluded according to the provisions of Article 253(2), Article 254(2), and Article 255 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, India. Therefore, it is decided to instruct the Mumbai High Court to conduct a retrial of this case. May 20, 2023."
