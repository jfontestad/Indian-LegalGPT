The offender may be liable for imprisonment for a term which may extend up to two years and a fine of up to ₹15,000, or both.\n\nIt's important to note that apart from legal penalties, driving under the influence of alcohol also poses a serious risk to public safety and can result in accidents causing injury or loss of life. It is always advisable to refrain from driving after consuming alcohol and to opt for alternate modes of transportation or designate a sober driver to ensure road safety."
